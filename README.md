# Year 3 Programming Group Project: HospitalAE Webpage
This is the webpage for the doctors. The link to login page is https://hospitalae.herokuapp.com/login.

The first step is login. The welcome page will first show up after successful login. There are five functions for the doctors on the welcome page, which are checking timetable by Timetable button, checking work load by the Wordload button, checking patients in charge by the My Patient button, selecting time availability at the end of each week by the time availability selection button, and discharging patient by the discharge button. 

Everytime the reception checks in a patient, it will be updated on specific doctor's webpage. The webpage uses the postgreSQL database on heroku therefore the whole webpage is on the cloud.
